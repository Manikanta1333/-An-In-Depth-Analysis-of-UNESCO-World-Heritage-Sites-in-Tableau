# -An-In-Depth-Analysis-of-UNESCO-World-Heritage-Sites-in-Tableau
📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, leveraging Tableau dashboards, storyboards, and real-world data to understand the global distribution, status, and preservation challenges of cultural and natural heritage treasures.

The study explores key dimensions of world heritage:

Heritage Type: Cultural, Natural, and Mixed Heritage Sites

Geographic Distribution: Analysis by Region, Country, and Continent

Conservation Status: Sites listed as "In Danger" vs. those not in danger

Historical Insights: Year-wise trends of site inscriptions

Site Density and Diversity: Regional and national representation of heritage


UNESCO World Heritage data helps highlight the richness of human history and biodiversity while raising awareness about preservation. Through this project, we aim to provide insights that support conservation efforts and global cultural appreciation.


🗂 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, containing detailed information on heritage sites across the world as of 2019. It includes both cultural and natural heritage sites that are recognized for their outstanding universal value.

Key attributes of the dataset:

Category: Type of site – Cultural, Natural, or Mixed

States_name_en: Country where the site is located

Region: Broader geographical region (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa)

Iso_code: Country code

Danger: Indicates whether the site is classified as In Danger

Date_inscribed: Year the site was officially inscribed on the World Heritage List

Longitude & Latitude: Geographic coordinates for mapping

Short_description_en: Brief summary of the site

Area_hectares: Size of the site in hectares (if available)


This structured dataset supports geographic, temporal, and categorical analysis to help visualize global heritage patterns and their conservation status.
