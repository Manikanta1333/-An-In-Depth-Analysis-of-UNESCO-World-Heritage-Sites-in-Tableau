# -An-In-Depth-Analysis-of-UNESCO-World-Heritage-Sites-in-Tableau
📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, leveraging Tableau dashboards, storyboards, and real-world data to understand the global distribution, status, and preservation challenges of cultural and natural heritage treasures.

The study explores key dimensions of world heritage:

Heritage Type: Cultural, Natural, and Mixed Heritage Sites

Geographic Distribution: Analysis by Region, Country, and Continent

Conservation Status: Sites listed as "In Danger" vs. those not in danger

Historical Insights: Year-wise trends of site inscriptions

Site Density and Diversity: Regional and national representation of heritage


UNESCO World Heritage data helps highlight the richness of human history and biodiversity while raising awareness about preservation. Through this project, we aim to provide insights that support conservation efforts and global cultural appreciation.
